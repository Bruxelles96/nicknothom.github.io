  The goal of this multirotor was to make it absolutely as small as possible while still using brushless motors and powerful ESCs. The end result is something with incredible performance and durability. It weighs 37 grams, 60 with a battery. Hovers for approximately 9 minutes, 5 - 6 minute flight time when really using the motors. It's capable of precision indoor flight, as well as flying in the wind outdoors.
  
  
  
  In my opinion, it's really the best of both worlds.
