description: >
  Ping is designed to be the ultimate compact echosounder for any aquatic project. It can be used for altitude sensing, as well as obstacle avoidance. 

  The small package makes it ideal for mounting on small robots and other platforms. All processing is done on a processor inside the unit, making it easy to integrate into anything. It is capable of detecting depths up to 150 feet, with a refresh rate of 10hz to 25hz depending on the distance it is measuring. 

  It will be for sale by Summer of 2017.
