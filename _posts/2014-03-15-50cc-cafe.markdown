description: |
  The goal of this project was to build a tiny, fast 50cc motorcycle. It's based on a 1991 Tomos Golden Bullet. Modifications: weight reduction, indicator delete, oil injection delete, LED lights, handmade seat, porting / polishing, 19mm dellorto carburetor, cut fenders, cold air intake, and an Estoril expansion chamber exhaust. 

  It's capable of a touch over 50mph. Slightly less in hot weather.
